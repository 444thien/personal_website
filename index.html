                    This is a mock dental management website that is targetted for dental patients and
                    dental staff to help with user experiences. This project was developed working
                    in a development team environment with rough deadlines enforced by a teacher.
                    The team framework used for this development cycle was SCRUM with daily meetings
                    and required communication between team members in order to achieve success.
